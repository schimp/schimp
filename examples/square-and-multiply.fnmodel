# Modular exponentiation can be implemented efficiently:
model square_mod/2 := {
	(_, _) -> {
		(1, 1) -> 1/10,
		(1, 2) -> 1/5,
		(1, 3) -> 2/5,
		(1, 4) -> 1/5,
		(1, 5) -> 1/10
	}

# Modular multiplication is much more expensive:
model multiply_mod/3 := {
	(_, _, _) -> {
		(1, 3) -> 1/10,
		(1, 4) -> 1/5,
		(1, 5) -> 2/5,
		(1, 6) -> 1/5,
		(1, 7) -> 1/10
